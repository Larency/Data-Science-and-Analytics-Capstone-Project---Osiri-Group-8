# Data-Science-and-Analytics-Capstone-Project---Osiri-Group-8
To solve a real-world problem, explain a phenomenon, or uncover actionable insights using a dataset

# Project Purpose
This capstone project challenges your team to apply the full Data Science lifecycle - from data acquisition to storytelling and modeling. The goal is to solve a real-world problem, explain a phenomenon, or uncover actionable insights using a dataset of your choice.
You are not just analyzing data, you are telling a compelling story, building predictive or prescriptive models, and demonstrating your readiness as data-driven problem solvers.

# Project Objectives
Each group will:
• Acquire, clean, and wrangle a real-world dataset
• Perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Build models (predictive, prescriptive, classification, or time series as relevant)
• Communicate findings via visualizations and compelling narratives
• Demonstrate teamwork, accountability, and technical growth
• Submit a well-documented GitHub repository with reproducible code

# Dataset Guidelines
• You are free to choose your own dataset.
• It must be:
  o Real-world (open data or scraped from real sources)
  o Sufficiently large/complex (minimum 1,000 rows and 10+ columns)
  o Related to a real-world issue (e.g., finance, health, education, marketing, sports, social media, etc.)
• Approved by your instructor by July 29, 2025.

# Possible Project Types (Choose One)
1. Problem Solving: Use data to solve a specific business, social, or operational problem
2. Phenomenon Exploration: Use data to understand and explain a societal or environmental phenomenon
3. Predictive Modeling: Use supervised learning to make predictions (e.g., regression or classification)
4. Prescriptive Analytics: Use optimization or simulation to recommend actions
5. Time Series Forecasting: Use historical time-based data to forecast future values

# Capstone Project Brief:
Data Science & Analytics (CSIS 503) Final Group Project
# Required Project Components
1. Data Pipeline & Preparation
• Data acquisition (source, scraping, or API)
• Data wrangling and feature engineering
• Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers
• Proper data typing and formatting
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Statistical summaries and insights
• Visual exploration (histograms, boxplots, pairplots, etc.)
• Key correlations, trends, or anomalies
3. Modeling (at least one of the following)
• Predictive (e.g., linear regression, classification)
• Time series (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet)
• Prescriptive (e.g., optimization, simulation)
• Models must include:
  o Evaluation metrics
  o Training/testing split
  o Interpretability (what the model tells us)
4. Data Storytelling & Communication
• Use charts and visualizations to explain findings clearly
• Translate technical results into real-world insights
• Address the original problem or question
5. Collaboration & Division of Labor
• While all team members are welcome to work across different project requirements, every group member must demonstrate ownership by taking on a meaningful, distinct role:
  o Examples: Data wrangler, EDA lead, modeling lead, visualizer, storyteller, project manager, QA reviewer
• Submit a 1-paragraph role summary for each member in your final deliverables (Report & Presentation Slide). The instructor will be providing each team member with an excel sheet to evaluate each member of their team and recommend what grade they get (10% of the course grade)
